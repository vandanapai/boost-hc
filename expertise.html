			        	<h2 class="light">Denial Management</h2>
			        	<h3 class="subhead"> Hospitals continue to be challenged by payers, including ERISA plans, that wrongfully deny, delay, and underpay claims.  As a result, one of the biggest questions facing hospitals is how to best allocate resources between obtaining payment on current claims and obtaining payment on denied and underpaid claims.
						</h3>

						<p>Most hospitals do not have the resources to effectively follow-up on every denied account to ensure recovery.  The time required to review claims, draft appeal letters and follow-up with payers is substantial.  Boost provides flexible resources to its clients to ensure the consistent resources necessary are devoted to turn denied claims into payments.</p>
	 
						<p>One of the toughest payer groups for hospitals is Out-of-Network ERISA self-funded employer plans.  Governed by federal law, these plans often claim to be exempt from state payment regulations.  </p>

						</h3>

						<p>Even with the best processes in place, most providers leave 1% - 5% of net revenue on the table. Boost specializes in working with your internal teams and processes to identify and recover this opportunity in zero-balance and denied claims.</p>
	 
						<p>What sets Boost apart is our ability to independently price claims and validate balances. We also provide detailed claims data summarizing the number of claims and dollars assigned along with the collection and write-off percentages. We summarize the root cause of the delayed payment or write-off to better help your staff moving forward.</p>

			        	<h3 class="subhead"> Workers' Compensation claims are a problem for many hospitals because they require extensive time and resources as well as the involvement of multiple parties. Navigating and negotiating with all of these parties requires frequent contact and can place extraordinary demands on hospital staff.

						<p>Boost specializes in workers' compensation account resolution with a team of expert claims professionals who understand both state payment fee schedules and federal guidelines.  Boost takes a hands-on approach, pursuing reimbursement through persistent follow-up and legal-based payment letters to ensure prompt payment.</p>
	 
						<p>Workers's Compensation claims can be placed with Boost as soon as Day 1.</p>
